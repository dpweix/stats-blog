    "text": "What is plotly?\nThere are many ways to visualize data in R. Most users default to either base graphics or ggplot2; however, plotly is also an option. The main advantage of plotly is that it can make graphics interactive. For example, if you hover your mouse near a point you can get its exact coordinates. Another example is zooming into a specific region on a plot.\nI know that many people are now thinking about shiny, but these packages provide different services. A shiny application allows for more customization and in depth interactivity; however, it must always be supported by a live R session. In plotly there is no need for a live R session. It is a more lightweight service."

Fortunately for us, ggplot2 objects can be directly converted into plotly objects with the ggplotly function.\nLet us consider a box plot using the mtcars data set in R. In the code below we visualize mpg by cyl.\n\n# Create and save ggplot2 object\nmy_plot <- \n  mtcars |> \n  mutate(cyl = as_factor(cyl)) |> \n  ggplot(aes(cyl, mpg)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n# Plot ggplot2 object\nmy_plot\n\n\n\n\nNotice the differences and similarities between the ggplot2 and plotly objects. Graphically they are identical; however, when we hover our mouse over the plotly version we are greeted with information and options. For instance, we can zoom into a single boxplot, get the exact numerical values, and save an image our altered plot.\n\n# Convert ggplot2 object to plotly object\nggplotly(my_plot)"
